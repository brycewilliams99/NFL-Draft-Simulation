Environment / IDE

  For the environment, atom.io was used for producing the code.  
  This IDE was used because of the simplicity it has with creating code in the different languages that are found.  
  The operating systems that I used were macOS and Windows 10.  They both work for compiling the code.  On macOS 
  the code was compiled using the python3 compiler via the terminal window. On the other hand, the windows version 
  was compiled yousing the python IDE.

Installing Python IDE
  
  As the same with installing Atom, the Python IDE is easy and simple to install onto your machine.  
  Just go to the Python IDE website if you are on Windows to download the IDE to start compiling code, or
  create code.
