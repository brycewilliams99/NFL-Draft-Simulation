# Stats Acceptance Test

Not much is needed when using the Stats.

Stats are reached after the user has went through the draft simulation.
The user is automatically shown stats after their draft is completed.

As of right now, the stas are set to the first week of the 2019 NFL season.

The program has all of the stats that are being used for the fantasy league.

# Output
For the output, since the stats are preconceived, the first stat for example is rushing yards.
You would get the output:
> Rushing
> * M.Mack carried 25 times for 174 yards and 1 touchdowns
> * C.McCaffrey carried 19 times for 128 yards and 2 touchdowns
> * S.Barkley carried 11 times for 120 yards and 0 touchdowns
> * D.Cook carried 21 times for 111 yards and 2 touchdowns
> * M.Ingram carried 14 times for 107 yards and 2 touchdowns

The rest of the stats would follow in the same fashion underneath.
