# Menu Acceptance Test

When a user starts the MenuFL.py file, they are greeted with a Menu that handles all the other files.
The user is given 3 options when starting the file.
1. Start Draft Simulation
2. Description of Program
3. Exit Program

If the user chooses 1, it will start the draft process with the user and the 3 bot teams.
If the user chooses 2 on the other hand, they will be given a short manual of what the program does and how it works.
The third option just exits the program.

# Output
Like stated above, if the user chooses 1, they will be taken to the Draft. (See Draft Acceptance Test)
If the user chooses 2, they will be given the following description of the program:
> "This is a program that simulates a virtual fantasy football game!
>
> The program gets its stats using an API called NFLGame.
> The API receives its stats from NFL.com Game Center.
>
> Go up against 3 randomly generated bot teams!
>
> In later iterations of this program, integration of more teams including more user teams.
>
> Press ENTER to go back to the Main Menu."

Finally, the third choice just exits the program.
